                                The brown bear is a large mammal known for its intelligence and solitary nature. It has
                                a remarkable adaptability that allows it to live in a wide variety of ecosystems in
                                North America (only North America), taking advantage of all available natural resources. It's more dangerous
                                to humans than black bears.

                                The lion is a powerful carnivorous feline and the only one that lives in social groups
                                called prides. It primarily inhabits the African savannas, where its role as top
                                predator is essential to maintaining ecosystem balance by regulating populations of
                                large herbivores.

                                The great white shark is the world's largest predatory fish, a solitary and feared
                                animal. To survive, it must constantly move, which allows it to allow oxygen into its
                                body through its gills and avoid sinking, as it lacks a swim bladder.
