            <h2>Defining Social Media</h2>
            <p> At its most basic level, social media consists of internet-based platforms that allow users to create and share content, engage in conversations, and form virtual communities.[2, 3] These platforms can take many forms, from blogs to photo-sharing, video-sharing, and social networking sites.[3]</p>
            <p> Modern social media platforms are characterized by two key components: first, the ability for users to construct a profile, upload their own content, view content from others, and interact through mechanisms like likes, comments, and shares.[1, 4] Second, they are governed by automated systems, primarily algorithms, that determine what content a user sees. These algorithms control feeds, suggest connections, and serve advertisements, thus shaping the user experience in a highly personalized manner.[4]</p>

            <h2>Conclusion: The Double-Edged Sword</h2>
            <p>The societal impact of social media is a story of contradictions. These platforms are simultaneously forces of new connection and deep division. They are tools for individual empowerment and vehicles for large misinformation. They build communities while sometimes exacerbating individual loneliness.The tension between these positive and negative outcomes is not accidental. It is a direct and predictable consequence of the engagement based business model that powers nearly every major social media platform. The primary goal of these platforms is to maximize user engagement, like time spent, likes, shares, commentsâ€”in order to collect data and sell targeted advertising.[1, 8] The algorithms that curate our feeds are meticulously optimized to achieve this single objective, consumption.[5]</p>
